# Fruit-Object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-application-using-Streamlit
Fruit Object Detection using YOLOv8: Developed a deep learning model to detect and classify fruits from images using YOLOv8. Implemented data preprocessing, augmentation, and transfer learning for improved accuracy. Built an interactive Streamlit app allowing users to upload images and view real-time detection results.
